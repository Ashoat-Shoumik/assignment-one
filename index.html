            <h2>About Tesla</h2>
            <p>Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH (formerly Grohmann Engineering GmbH) is a German engineering automation company[2] based in Pr√ºm in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The company operates a development center in Neutraubling, Bavaria, as well as support offices in Chandler, Arizona, and Shanghai, China.[3] The company was founded in 1963 by Klaus Grohmann and acquired by Tesla, Inc., in January 2017. Klaus Grohmann was ousted after clashing with Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, after Tesla had acquired the company.
                <br>
                <br>The product portfolio includes machinery for the production of microprocessors and memory chips, airbag sensors and power steering controllers, as well as systems for the production of car door and roof seals, lithium-ion battery cells and modules. Among other things, the company manufactures robotics that are used in the battery and electronics production for Tesla, Inc. at its Gigafactory 1</p>

            <h2>Autopilot</h2>
            <p>Autopilot
                Available since around 2015, Autopilot started as an extra feature you could add for a hefty fee to complement your driving. The advanced driving system would auto-steer, keep up with other vehicles, brake for slower traffic, and generally help out with highway driving, as long as the driver kept eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.</p>

            <p>Supercharging
                Tesla has its own charging network, exclusive to Tesla owners. Other EVs (like Rivian and Jeep) are starting to build out their own networks as well, but none are as extensive as Tesla's. Supercharging is available across the U.S. and in other countries where Teslas are sold: There are more than 25,000 superchargers. The fast charging adds up to 200 miles.</p>

            <h2>Dog mode</h2>
            <p>Dog mode
                Just like it sounds like, Dog mode is for dogs to chill in the car. Parked cars overheat and are unsafe for dogs, but with this mode engaged, the car is kept cool with the air system still on even with the car in park. Plus, an on-screen message on the center console says "My owner will be back soon" to let passersby know your dog is safe.</p>
